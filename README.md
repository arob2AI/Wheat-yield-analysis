# Wheat-yield-analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring temporal
trends in wheat yield and temperature using Python.

The analysis involves data preprocessing and visualization to examine patterns
and potential relationships between crop yield and climatic variables such as temperature change. 

Libraries such as pandas and matplotlib are used to handle and visualize data alongside Numpy and Seaborn.

Further refinements and extensions may be incorporated in future updates.
